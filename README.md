# KeepUp

![KeepUp Logo](/public/images/logo.png)

Your personal assistant for keeping your Linux systems up-to-date!

## Features

- Add, remove and monitor systems remotely via SSH password-based authentication and private-key-based authentication, and get automatically:
    - Operating System
    - Uptime
    - Updates available
    - IP addresses of the remote machine

## Roadmap

For now, everything needed from my side is currently implemented, but you're very welcome to contribute to the project by opening a PR!

Maybe... a remote SSH shell directly from the browser? :)
